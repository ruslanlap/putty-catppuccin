# How to Modify PuTTY Color Settings to Cattpucin style

This README provides instructions on how to use the included Windows registry (.reg) file to modify the color schemes in PuTTY.

## Prerequisites

- PuTTY installed on your Windows machine
- The Catp.reg registry file included in this repo

## Instructions

1. Download Catp.reg or copy it from this repo

3. Double click on Catp.reg to open the Windows Registry Editor
4. Click Yes to merge the registry file into the Windows Registry
5. Open PuTTY and go to Window > Saved Seesion
6. Select the "Catp" scheme from the Saved sessions dropdown 
7. Click Openy to apply the color scheme

And you're done! The next time you open an SSH session in PuTTY it will use the customized Catp color theme.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
